# Problem 1

### Part A: Data Loading and Summary

The penguins data from the package `palmerpenguins` is loaded and described below.

```{r Problem_1}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

skimr::skim(penguins)
```

The penguins dataset contains `r ncol(penguins)` columns and `r nrow(penguins)` rows. Information about the variables including variable type and summary statistics are included in the output of the `skim()` function above.

The mean flipper length is `r penguins %>% pull(flipper_length_mm) %>% mean(na.rm=TRUE)`.

### Part B. Plot and Output

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, 
       mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
geom_point()
```
